## Diabetes and Cardiovascular Conditions Analysis

This project aims to explore the relationship between diabetes status and the presence of hypertension, heart disease, or both conditions. Through hypothesis testing and data visualization, we investigate whether diabetics are more likely to have these cardiovascular conditions compared to non-diabetics.

# Installation
There are no specific installation requirements for this project. However, ensure you have Python and the necessary libraries installed to execute the provided code.

# Usage
Users can analyze the provided code to understand the statistical analysis and visualizations conducted to explore the relationship between diabetes status and cardiovascular conditions.

# Features
Hypothesis testing using Z-tests of proportions.
Data visualization with bar plots to illustrate counts of individuals based on diabetes status and cardiovascular conditions.
Statistical analysis to determine significant differences in the likelihood of having cardiovascular conditions between diabetics and non-diabetics.

## Analysis Overview

Hypotheses‚ùî

Null Hypothesis (H0): The likelihood of having either hypertension, heart disease, or both conditions is the same for both diabetic and non-diabetic populations.
Alternative Hypothesis (H1): The likelihood of having either hypertension, heart disease, or both conditions is significantly higher for diabetics compared to non-diabetics.
# Analysis Steps
  1) Data Visualization:
           Bar plots depict counts of individuals categorized by diabetes status and cardiovascular conditions.
     
  2) Hypothesis Testing (Z-Test of Proportions):
          Z-tests of proportions compare the proportions of individuals with cardiovascular conditions between diabetic and non-diabetic populations.
          Calculation of z-statistics and p-values to determine significant differences.

# Test Results:

No Hypertension & Heart Disease: Significant difference found; diabetics less likely than non-diabetics.

Hypertension Only: Significant difference found; diabetics more likely than non-diabetics.

Heart Disease Only: Significant difference found; diabetics more likely than non-diabetics.

Both Hypertension & Heart Disease: Significant difference found; diabetics more likely than non-diabetics.

#### Conclusion:
Based on the z-tests of proportions, we reject the null hypothesis, concluding that the likelihood of having hypertension, heart disease, or both conditions is significantly higher for diabetics compared to non-diabetics.
